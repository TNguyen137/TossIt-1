This is the Github for the TossIt waste and recycling crowdsourcing application.

To use the exisiting code:

1. Clone the Repository
2. CD to the TossIt directory
3. Make sure you have Node.js installed so you can use NPM from the command line
4. Make sure you have React-Native and its necessary components installed, if not goto: <br />
   -https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
5. Run the following commands while in the project directory:<br />
   -npm install<br />
   -npm install react-native-maps --save<br />
   -npm install firebase --save<br />
   -react-native link<br />
6. Then run the application using:<br />
   -react-native run-android<br />

Potential problems:  
SDK Version too low:  
 1. Make sure Android Studio is the lastest version
 2. Then use Android Studio to open the Android folder
 3. The same error should occur and Android Studio will ask to auto fix the version problem
 4. After its fixed and gradle is synced, goto Tools >> Make Project
