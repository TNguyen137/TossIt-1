This is the Github for the TossIt waste and recycling crowdsourcing application designed for the class CS4251.

To use the exisiting code:

1. Clone the Repository
2. CD to the TossIt directory
3. Make sure you have Node.js installed so you can use NPM from the command line
4. Run the following commands while in the project directory:
   npm install
   npm install react-native-maps --save
   npm install firebase --save
   react-native link
5. Then run the application using:
   react-native run-android

Potential problems:  
SDK Version too low:  
  Make sure Android Studio is the lastest version
  Then use Android Studio to open the Android folder
  The same error should occur and Android Studio will ask to auto fix the version problem
  After its fixed and gradle is synced, goto Tools >> Make Project
